Why I chose them:

Located in Salt Lake City, Utah.
1. It is located in a residential area, with many surrounding residential buildings, but they are relatively similar. You can build a relatively different appearance and become a Street landmark.
2. It is located at the corner of the street to avoid being blocked by other buildings.
