Sparrows House | Previous Search

---
This project is about designing a tiny house with an area of no more than 400 square feet in Salt Lake City, USA.

Â·The following is my understanding of home:
Home is a place that can shelter from wind and rain, keep warm in winter, and get cool in summer. At the same time, it should have comprehensive functions and be able to cook, to have the breath of life; Can rest, let the body relax; Can entertain, make the mind feel comfortable, of course, the bathroom is also essential. It must have good privacy, but at the same time, it can't make people living in it feel depressed and too closed; It can be small, but not crowded. It can also meet the needs of two people living in it and have a certain storage space. It's best to put down a car.
