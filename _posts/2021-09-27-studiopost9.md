Sparrows House | Design

---
This project is about designing a tiny house with an area of no more than 400 square feet in Salt Lake City, USA.

Some new ideas：

1．	The glass wall is covered by solar panels during the day to form a solar energy storage system, which can be opened at night.

2. Terrazzo：Environmentally friendly materials, waste glass bottle fragments or other crystals can be made to look better in the sun. It can be used to make the floor around the glass wall.

3. The ground floor’s wall panel can be opened when more space or more space for parking is required.

4. HempCrete（more strong and lighter）

It is a concrete-like material created from the woody inner fibres of the hemp plant. The fibres are bound with lime to create concrete-like shapes that are strong and light. Hemp concrete blocks are lightweight, dramatically reducing the energy used to transport the blocks. Hempcrete is sturdy, has good thermal and acoustic insulation qualities and is fire resistant. Additionally, its biggest sustainable property is that it is CO2 negative, meaning it absorbs more CO2 than it emits. Hemp itself is a fast-growing and renewable resource.
